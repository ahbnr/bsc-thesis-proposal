\section{Motivation}
Reasoning about software which employs asynchronous interaction between its
components is usually difficult.
For example, one might want to ensure, that said components adhere to a specific
protocol, or that resources are properly allocated and released between uses.

When manually checking a software model against a protocol specification becomes
to labor intensive and time consuming, automatic verification can reduce the
workload and help to avoid human errors.

Furthermore, if behavior can be dynamically added to the software during execution,
for instance by an interface of the runtime, the set of properties which
can be proven by static analysis of the software can become very limited.

Even in this case, some guarantees can still be enforced, if the schedulers of
asynchronous processes are aware of a protocol and only activate those tasks
which do not violate it.

\paragraph{Thesis Topic}

The Abstract Behavioral Specification language (ABS) is intended for modelling
``concurrent, distributed, object-oriented'' software systems (TODO: link) and
aims for `verifiable design'' via a suite of external tools (TODO: link).

This thesis is based on work by (TODO: Reference) and aims at developing a tool
for automatically verifying whether objects within an ABS software model comply
with a communication protocol, which can be specified using Behavioral Types
(TODO: Link).

Furthermore, it will extend all participating objects with a scheduler which
ensures, that only tasks are activated during execution that the protocol permits.
This is necessary, since (tool X) allows to asynchronously call any method during
runtime, which will invalidate static verification.
This idea has been explored by (TODO) in (...).

% Note that this approach can not guarantee 

(...) also introduces Async Dynamic Logic (ADL) such that ADL formulas can
accompany protocol specifications and allow to express logical constraints on the
program state before method invocations and after their termination.
Although automatic verification of those constraints could  be implemented using
Key-ABS (LINK), it will likely exceed the timing constraints of the thesis.
Instead, those constraints will optionally be implemented as runtime assertions,
if time allows.

\section{Working Packages}
%
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{assets/architecture.pdf}

All of the following work packages include a time investment proportional to the
complexity of the package, which is reserved for conducting the necessary
research using papers relevant to the topic. Also some time will be required for
detailed planning of the implementation of the package and recording the results
within the thesis document.

\begin{enumdescript}
\item[\namedlabel{Behavioral Types syntax \& parser}{WPsyntaxAndParser}]%
    The verification tool will require an input source where developers can
    define their protocol specifications using Behavioral Types.

    Coupling between the ABS compiler and the verification tool shall be avoided
    as much as possible, such that no further complexity is introduced into Core
    ABS (TODO Link) and the projects can be developed and maintained independently.
    
    Therefore the verification tool shall parse its input from a file independent
    from the ABS source code of the software model.

    This work package includes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item deriving a practical syntax for defining Behavioral Types from (LINKS)
      \item developing a parser which provides the types as a data structure
        suitable for...
      \begin{itemize}
        \item association with AST nodes of the ABS source file
        \item processing by the type checker (Refernce working package) (Projection (Reference), ...)
      \end{itemize}
      \item this does not include syntax and parsing functionality for explicit
        local types, see work package X
    \end{itemize}
  \item[\namedlabel{Passing AST from ABS parser to tool}{WPPassAST}]%
    Most further work packages require the external types to be associated with
    the AST of the software model's ABS source code.

    Code duplication should be avoided and therefore the AST generated by the
    ABS compiler shall be used, however as mentioned in (reference package),
    the ABS compiler shall be modified as few as possible.

    Also some work packages (links) entail modifying the AST.
    Therefore the potentially modified AST must be passed back to the ABS
    compiler such that it can be compiled into an executable
    form. The thesis only aims to create an AST compatible with the Erlang backend.
    %
    This work package shall produce a tool with the following work flow:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item parsing software model source code and applying Core ABS type
        checking to it using the ABS frontend.
      \item invoking parser of external type specifications as specified in work
        package X
      \item loading both data structures into the tool. After work packages
        X or Y have been completed, this step will include modifycations to
        the AST using the external type definitons
      \item passing (modified) AST back to ABS compiler to complete compilation
    \end{enumerate}
  \item[\namedlabel{Projection \& typechecking local action order}{WPProjectionAndTC}]%
    For the most part, the external type definitions will specify a global
    protocol which needs to be \emph{projected} on the individual units of the
    software model (objects, methods).
    This ultimately allows for typechecking methods against the specification
    and generating schedulers (see ...).
    %
    This work package includes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item implementing projection
      \item implementing typechecker which statically ensures well-formedness
        of the program
        \begin{itemize}
          \item this does not include checking for deadlocks or verifying ADL
            formulas embedded within the types (see ...)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item[\namedlabel{Extending ABS scheduler functionality}{WPExtendScheduler}]%
    The implementation of work package X requires, that schedulers are able to
    halt execution, if the execution of any available process would violate the
    specified protocol. They should continue execution, as soon as a viable
    process is available.

    As of now, this this not supported by user defined schedulers in ABS,
    therefore it must be implemented as part of the thesis.

    This work package includes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item extending ABS compiler frontend to support scheduler functions which
        may not return a process to execute (support for \texttt{Maybe<...>}
        return type).
        \item this includes modifying the parser and AST generation
        \item this does not include modifications to the (Erlang) backend
          compiler. The necessary adjustments to the backend compiler will be
          provided by Rudi X, one of the core developers of ABS.
    \end{itemize}
  \item[\namedlabel{Generating schedulers}{WPGenSchedulers}]%
    To ensure the protocol specified by the external type definitions are not
    violated at runtime due to remote procedure calls, scheduler functions (link)
    shall be generated from the type definitions for all objects participating
    in the protocol and integrated into the AST of the software model.

    This work package includes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item deriving Session Automata (link) from the type definitions.
      \item transforming the Session Automata into pure scheduler functions (reference)
      \item validating, that the constructed automata indeed comply to the
        type specification
      \item integrating the schedulers into the AST provided by the ABS compiler
    \end{itemize}
  \item[\namedlabel{Explicit local types}{WPExplicitTypes}]%
    As presented in X, behavioral types may explicitly be formulated to specific
    classes, not only as one global specification.

    This can be used to specify valid behavior for an object across the whole
    protocol specification. For example, a file class shall only allow execution
    of its ``read'' method in between invocations of its open and close methods.

    This work package includes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item extending the syntax and parser of work package X with support for
        explicit local types
      \item developing a notion of compatibility between explicit local types
        and local types projected from the global one.
      \item extending type checker of work package X such that it compares
        projected local types against explicit local ones to determine
        compatibility
      \item replace projected local types with explicit ones, if compatibility
        test was successful.
    \end{itemize}
  \item[\namedlabel{Optional: Extending ABS Future wrapper}{WPAnyFut}]%
    Implementation of work package X requires, that asynchronous method
    invocations may not only return objects, but data of any type, since the ADL
    formulas as described in ... allow to reason about the state of returned
    results of methods, which may belong to any type.

    As of now, this this not supported by the \texttt{Fut<T>} type of ABS and
    therefore the compiler frontend and the (Erlang) backend have to be extended.

    This work package includes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item extending ABS compiler frontend to support wrapping any type
        \texttt{T} in Futures \texttt{Fut<T>}
      \item this includes modifying the parser and AST generation
        \item this does not include modifications to the (Erlang) backend
          compiler. The necessary adjustments to the backend compiler will be
          provided by Rudi X, one of the core developers of ABS.
    \end{itemize}
  \item[\namedlabel{Optional: Generating assertions from ADL formulas}{WPAssertions}]%
    As outlined in (reference), the external type definitions may carry ADL
    formulas which describe constraints on the models state during execution.

    Those formulas shall be checked during execution of the model by extending
    the AST with assertion statements (link) which implement the constraints
    described by the formula.

    This work package includes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item determining a transformation function from ADL formulas to ABS
        boolean expressions which may be placed in assertions.
      \item determining correct placement of the assertion statements within
        the software model's AST
      \item generating assertion statements and integrating them into the AST
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumdescript}

\section{Time Schedule}

\paragraph{Available time}
%
A bachelor's thesis has to be written within 6 months.
It should ammount to about 12 credit points of work, which translate to $12 \mathrm{CP} \cdot 30 \frac{\mathrm{h}}{\mathrm{CP}} = 360 \mathrm{h}$.
Therefore, when assuming an even distribution of the work, this corresponds to about $14 \mathrm{h}$ per week.

Increased preparation effort for exams is to be expected around the time from
the 8th of July to the 8th of August. This corresponds to about 9.5 weeks from the
start of the thesis when assuming the 1st of May as starting point.
Since around that time the work packages with the biggest timeframes are
scheduled, this should provide a slight safety margin to account for the
heightened workload.

The implementation of the working package regarding generating schedulers
\ref{WPGenSchedulers} is split into to parts to accomodate for a week of
preparation for the intermediate presentation which will probably take place
around that time.
